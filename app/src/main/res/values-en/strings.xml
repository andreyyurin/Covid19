    <string name="info_1"><![CDATA[Coronaviruses are a large family of viruses that can cause various diseases in humans - from the common cold to SARS. Viruses from this family also cause a number of diseases in animals.
<br><br>
The new coronavirus is a special strain of coronaviruses not previously detected in humans. Due to the fact that only a few cases of the disease are registered to date, information on the transmission, severity and clinical impact of the infection is very limited.]]></string>

    <string name="info_3"><![CDATA[MERS-CoV is a zoonotic virus, that is, a virus transmitted between animals and humans. Studies have shown that people become infected through direct and indirect contact with infected camels. MERS-CoV was detected in one-humped camels in several countries in the Middle East, Africa and South Asia.
<br><br>
The origin of this virus is not fully known, but according to the analysis of various genomes of the virus, it is believed that it arose among bats and was transmitted to one-humped camels in the distant past.]]></string>

    <string name="info_5"><![CDATA[<ul>
          <li>&nbsp; Middle East Respiratory Syndrome (MERS) is a viral respiratory disease caused by the new coronavirus (Middle East Respiratory Syndrome or MERS-CoV), which was first diagnosed in Saudi Arabia in 2012.</li>
          <li>&nbsp; Coronaviruses are a large family of viruses that can cause illnesses from the common cold to severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS).</li>
          <li>&nbsp; Typical symptoms of MERS include fever, coughing, and shortness of breath. Pneumonia is common, but not always present. Gastroenterological symptoms, including diarrhea, are also recorded.</li>
          <li>&nbsp; Some laboratory-confirmed cases of MERS-CoV infection are reported as asymptomatic, that is, patients have no clinical symptoms, but the results of laboratory testing of samples taken from them are positive for MERS-CoV. Most of these asymptomatic cases have been identified as a result of active monitoring of patient contacts with laboratory-confirmed disease.</li>
          <li>&nbsp; Approximately 35% of registered MERS-CoV patients died.</li>
          <li>&nbsp; Although the majority of human cases of MERS-CoV are attributable to the transmission of infection between people in medical institutions, the current scientific evidence suggests that one-humped camels are the main reservoir host for MERS-CoV and a source of infection for humans of MERS. However, the exact role of camels in the transmission of the virus and the specific transmission route (s) are unknown.</li>
          <li>&nbsp; It is assumed that the virus does not pass freely from person to person, unless there is close contact between them, for example, when a patient is provided with medical care without protective equipment. Outbreaks related to the provision of medical care occurred in a number of countries, and the largest of them - in Saudi Arabia, the United Arab Emirates and the Republic of Korea.</li>

    <string name="syms_1"><![CDATA[<b>Symptoms</b><br>]]></string>

    <string name="syms_2"><![CDATA[The clinical manifestations of MERS-CoV infection range from the absence of symptoms (asymptomatic course) or mild respiratory symptoms to severe acute respiratory illness and death. A typical picture of MERS-CoV is high fever, coughing and shortness of breath. Usually, but not always, pneumonia is detected. Gastroenterological symptoms, including diarrhea, are also recorded. In severe illness, respiratory arrest may occur, which requires mechanical ventilation and assistance in the intensive care unit. The virus appears to cause a more severe course of the disease in older people, those with weakened immune systems and those suffering from chronic diseases such as cancer, chronic lung diseases and diabetes.
<br><br>
Approximately 35% of patients with MERS have died, but this rate may be overestimated compared to the actual mortality rate, since mild cases of MERS can remain overlooked by existing surveillance systems, and mortality rates are calculated only among laboratory-confirmed patients before gaining deeper knowledge about this disease. a disease.]]></string>

    <string name="faq_2"><![CDATA[Coronaviruses are a vast family of viruses with proven pathogenic properties to humans or animals. A number of coronaviruses are known to cause respiratory infections in humans ranging from a common cold to more serious conditions such as Middle Eastern respiratory syndrome (MEIS) and severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS). The last of the recently discovered coronaviruses causes COVID-19. <br>]]></string>
    <string name="faq_4"><![CDATA[COVID-19 is an infectious disease caused by the last of the recently discovered coronaviruses. Before the outbreak in Wuhan, China, in December 2019, nothing was known about the new virus and the disease.<br>]]></string>
    <string name="faq_6"><![CDATA[The most common symptoms of COVID-19 include increased body temperature, fatigue and dry cough. A number of patients may experience a variety of pains, stuffy nose, runny nose, pharyngitis or diarrhoea. These symptoms tend to develop gradually and are poorly defined. Some infected persons do not develop any symptoms or ill health. In most people (about 80%), the disease ends in recovery, with no specific therapeutic measures required. Approximately one in six cases of COVID-19 develops severe symptoms with respiratory failure. Older persons as well as persons with existing somatic diseases such as arterial hypertension, heart disease or diabetes are more likely to develop severe symptoms. If you have fever, cough or difficulty breathing, you should seek medical help. <br>]]></string>
    <string name="faq_8"><![CDATA[2019-nCoV can be contracted from other people if they are infected with the virus. It can be transmitted from person to person through small droplets emitted from the nose or mouth of a COVID-19 patient when coughing or sneezing. These droplets get on objects and surfaces around the person. Other people may become infected by touching such objects or surfaces first and then the eyes, nose or mouth. In addition, infection can occur by inhaling small droplets that are released when a person coughs or sneezes with COVID-19. For this reason, it is important to keep a distance of more than 1 meter from a sick person.
<br>
WHO is following up on research on modes of transmission of COVID-19 and will publish information as it is updated.<br>]]></string>
    <string name="faq_10"><![CDATA[According to current scientific data, the smaller droplets emitted from the respiratory tract are a more important transmission factor than air. See the answer to the previous question, "How is the virus spreading?"<br>]]></string>
    <string name="faq_12"><![CDATA[The virus mainly spreads through droplets released from the human respiratory tract by coughing or sneezing. The risk of infection from a person who has no symptoms is extremely low. On the other hand, many people have very few symptoms of COVID-19. This is especially true in the early stages of the disease. Thus, there is a risk of COVID-19 transmission from a person who does not feel sick and has only a mild cough. WHO monitors the progress of ongoing research on the interval of time that a sick person remains contagious and will publish information as it is updated. <br>]]></string>
    <string name="faq_14"><![CDATA[Apparently, the risk of 2019-nCoV infection through the faeces of an infected person is low. Preliminary studies indicate that the virus may be found in some cases in the faeces, but that this mechanism of transmission does not play a leading role in the current outbreak. WHO is studying the results of ongoing research on the transmission of COVID-19 and will publish information as it is updated. This risk cannot be completely eliminated, and it reaffirms the importance of regular hand washing after using the toilet and before eating. <br>]]></string>
    <string name="faq_16"><![CDATA[The level of risk is determined by your location, or more precisely by the presence or absence of an outbreak in that area.<br>
For most people in most regions, the risk of COVID-19 infection is still low. However, in some parts of the world (cities or areas) the disease continues to spread. The risk of infection is higher for those living in or visiting such areas. National governments and health authorities are responding vigorously to each new case of COVID-19 infection. If there are local restrictions on travel, movement or mass events, follow this regime. By supporting disease control measures, you can reduce the risk of COVID-19 infection or spread.
<br>
As China and a number of other countries have shown, it is in our power to limit the spread of outbreaks and stop the transmission of infection. Unfortunately, outbreaks can quickly occur in new foci. It is important to remain aware of the situation in your region or the region you are planning to visit. WHO publishes daily updates on the current COVID-19 epidemiological situation around the world.<br>

<br>]]></string>
    <string name="faq_18"><![CDATA[Coronavirus infection COVID-19 usually occurs in mild forms, especially in children and young people. However, there is a severe form of infection: in about one out of five cases, those who become ill require hospitalization. The concern of people for themselves and their loved ones about the outbreak of COVID-19 is therefore justified.
<br>
We can channel our efforts in a constructive way and take action to protect our own health, that of our loved ones and that of our community. The most important and primary measure is regular and thorough hand washing as well as adherence to respiratory hygiene rules. Secondly, there is a need to monitor developments and follow the recommendations of local health authorities, including restrictions on travel, movement or mass events.<br>
]]></string>
    <string name="faq_20"><![CDATA[Our information on COVID-19 is not yet complete, but it appears that severe illness is more prevalent in older people as well as in people with existing somatic diseases (e.g. hypertension, heart, lung, cancer or diabetes).<br>]]></string>
    <string name="faq_22"><![CDATA[No. Antibiotics don t work on viruses, they only work on bacterial infections. COVID-19 disease is of viral nature, so antibiotics are ineffective. Antibiotics should not be used for the prevention or treatment of COVID-19. They should only be used when prescribed by a doctor to treat bacterial infections. <br>]]></string>
    <string name="faq_24"><![CDATA[A number of Western medicines, as well as traditional folk or home remedies, may contribute to the improvement and relief of the symptoms of COVID-19, however, there is currently no evidence to suggest that any of the available medicines can prevent or treat the disease. WHO does not recommend self-treatment with any medication, including antibiotics, to prevent or treat COVID-19 infection. At the same time, a number of drugs are being clinically tested in both Western and traditional folk medicine. WHO will continue to publish updates as clinical data become available.<br>]]></string>
    <string name="faq_26"><![CDATA[No. The virus causing COVID-19 belongs to the same family of viruses as the pathogen for severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS-CS), but it s a different virus. SARS is more dangerous but less infectious than COVID-19. No outbreaks of SARS have been reported anywhere in the world since 2003.<br>]]></string>
    <string name="faq_28"><![CDATA[You should only wear the mask if you have symptoms of COVID-19 (especially coughing) or if you are caring for someone who may be suffering from COVID-19. Disposable masks should not be reused. If you have no symptoms, or if you are not caring for someone who is sick, it is not wise to use a disposable mask. At present, there is a shortage of masks in the world, so the WHO encourages everyone to use them sparingly.
<br>
WHO advocates for the rational use of medical masks to avoid wasting valuable resources as well as improper use of masks (see Guidelines for Use of Masks).
<br>
Among the most effective measures to protect your own and others health from COVID-19 is frequent hand washing, covering your nose and mouth with an elbow bend or a coughing cloth, and maintaining a distance of at least 1 meter with people who cough or sneeze. More information can be found in the section on basic precautions for protection against new coronavirus infection.<br>]]></string>
    <string name="faq_30"><![CDATA[The incubation period is the period of time between infection and the appearance of clinical symptoms of the disease. According to most estimates, the duration of the incubation period of COVID-19 ranges from 1 to 14 days, most commonly around five days. These estimates will be refined as new data become available.<br>]]></string>
    <string name="faq_32"><![CDATA[Coronaviruses make up a large family of viruses and are widely distributed in animals. Infection of people with these viruses and their subsequent transmission to other people occurs from time to time. For example, SARS-CVs have been found to infect humans from civets and BVRS-CVs from single-humped camels. A possible source of 2019-nCoV in animals has not yet been identified.
<br>
As a measure of personal protection, for example when visiting markets where animals are traded, direct contact with animals should be avoided, as well as contact with surfaces with which animals come into contact. Food safety regulations should be strictly observed. Care should be taken when handling raw meat, milk and animal organs to avoid cross-contamination of other unheated products and to avoid eating raw or semi raw animal products.<br>]]></string>

    <string name="faq_34"><![CDATA[No. No data are available on cases of infection among companion pets (cats, dogs) or on the spread of the virus causing COVID-19.<br>]]></string>
    <string name="faq_36"><![CDATA[The survival time of the 2019-nCoV virus on the surfaces has not yet been precisely determined, but it is assumed to be similar to other members of the coronavirus family by this parameter. Studies (including preliminary data on the causative agent COVID-19) show that the virus will survive on surfaces for several hours to several days. Specific timing depends on a number of conditions (e.g. surface type, ambient temperature and humidity).
<br>
If you suspect that a surface may contain a virus, treat it with a conventional disinfectant to destroy the microorganisms and protect yourself and others. Remember to treat your hands with alcoholic beverages or wash them with soap. Do not touch your eyes, mouth or nose.
<br>]]></string>
    <string name="faq_38"><![CDATA[Yes. The likelihood that the infection could be transmitted from an infected person through ordered goods is low, as is the risk of COVID-19 contamination from packages that have been moved, transported and exposed to different weather and temperature conditions.<br>]]></string>
